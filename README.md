# **2D Test Track Planner Simulator** (Final Project for Service Desk)
<!--
Badges: On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such
as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields
to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a
badge.
Visuals: Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include
screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos)
Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

This project is a simply 2D simulator to run routines which are generated paths composed by way points. You'll get a window of the robot moving around the map and get some cinematic descriptors like average robot's speed, time of the routine, difficulty, and others. This project is to validate the knowledge of new candidates which are applying for a roll in the AI Service Desk team, we'll evaluate concepts and basics of ROS2 (galactic), Docker, Python, C++, Git, LinuxOS, APIs, programming order and style, among others.
